## Codeblock-Colorful-Theme
Codeblock is one of the most popular ide for c/c++, but the problem is it has a very limited theme and it's really irritating to work in such a light environment. Furthermore, it humpers the programmer's eyes. Wouldn't it be great if you could use a customized theme to decorate it like VSCode and other IDEs? Let's Do it Then.
